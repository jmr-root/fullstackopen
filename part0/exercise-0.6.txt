the browser makes requests (GET) to the server for:
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js

Then load the data JSON called from the .js and return the content of the OBJECT.

When we insert a value in the input form, this is sent by POST resquest to:
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa.

This note POST is sent using JAVASCRIPT code. First, either create a function that stores 
the note in a variable and then pushes it to the array.

Then the data is sent (JSON-string) with an HTTP POST request with a Content-type header. 
They are drawn again by the redrawNotes()function.
